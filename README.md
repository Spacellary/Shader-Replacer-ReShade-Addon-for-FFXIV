### Silent's Messy Shader Mod - ReShade Add-on version for FFXIV
Created by user [4lex4nder](https://github.com/4lex4nder).
###### "ReShade version of Silent's shader replacements."

#### Notable qualities still present in this version include:
* Much improved native Debanding (you'll notice there's a lot less color banding in the skybox).
* Better Colors and Contrast, with the removal of the dreaded yellow-ish tint from the game, presentation is clearer.
* You can still use all of your other ReShade shaders and Presets, while still benefiting from these improvements.

##### For more information read the description from the original here: <br> https://github.com/s-ilent/smsm-ff14.


### Installation/Usage:
1. Download/extract the `ShaderFixes` folder, that goes to your FFXIV installation folder, alongside the `ffxiv_dx11.exe`.
2. `shader_replace.addon` goes into your Add-on search path directory. <br>
You can configure that one in the Add-ons tab in the in-game ReShade interface.
3. Enable the `Shader Replace` add-on in the Addo-ns tab and restart the game.

#### Notes:
* Configurations aren't loaded in this version, so there's no point in changing them. At this stage, all the add-on does is load the shaders that are inside the `ShaderFixes` folder directly without customization.
* Tested with ReShade 5.7.0.
